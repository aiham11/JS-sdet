Yes, the code will stop the execution of that particular operation if it encounters the `502 Bad Gateway` error three times. After three unsuccessful retries, it will log an error message indicating that the attachment creation failed after retries, and the method will return `null`, which indicates that the operation was unsuccessful.

The rest of the code will continue to execute as normal, but any subsequent logic that depends on the successful creation of the attachment (e.g., logging, processing other attachments, etc.) might need to check whether the attachment operation was successful by verifying if the return value is `null`.

If you'd like to stop the entire execution of the program upon encountering this error three times, you can add additional logic to handle that scenario. For example, you could throw an exception after the retries fail, which would stop the program if not caught. Here's how you can do it:

```java
private String attachFileToRallyTestCase(RallyRestApi rallyApi, String testCaseId, String filePath) throws IOException {
    if (testCaseId == null || testCaseId.isEmpty()) {
        logger.error("TestCase ID is null or empty. Cannot attach file: " + filePath);
        return null;
    }

    byte[] fileContent = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(filePath));
    String encodedContent = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(fileContent);

    String contentType = determineContentType(filePath);

    JsonObject attachmentContent = new JsonObject();
    attachmentContent.addProperty("Content", encodedContent);

    CreateRequest attachmentContentRequest = new CreateRequest("AttachmentContent", attachmentContent);
    
    int retryCount = 3;
    while (retryCount > 0) {
        CreateResponse attachmentContentResponse = rallyApi.create(attachmentContentRequest);

        if (attachmentContentResponse.wasSuccessful()) {
            String attachmentContentRef = attachmentContentResponse.getObject().get("_ref").getAsString();
            logger.info("AttachmentContentRef: " + attachmentContentRef);

            JsonObject attachment = new JsonObject();
            attachment.addProperty("Artifact", "/testcase/" + testCaseId);
            attachment.addProperty("Content", attachmentContentRef);
            attachment.addProperty("Name", Paths.get(filePath).getFileName().toString());
            attachment.addProperty("Description", "Jira to Rally Migration Automated Attachments");
            attachment.addProperty("ContentType", contentType);
            attachment.addProperty("Size", fileContent.length);

            CreateRequest attachmentRequest = new CreateRequest("Attachment", attachment);
            CreateResponse attachmentResponse = rallyApi.create(attachmentRequest);

            if (attachmentResponse.wasSuccessful()) {
                String attachmentURL = attachmentResponse.getObject().get("_ref").getAsString();
                logger.info("Attachment URL: " + attachmentURL);
                return attachmentURL;
            } else {
                logger.error("Error creating Attachment for file " + filePath + ": " + String.join(", ", attachmentResponse.getErrors()));
                return null;
            }
        } else if (attachmentContentResponse.getErrors().toString().contains("502 Bad Gateway")) {
            logger.warn("502 Bad Gateway error encountered. Retrying...");
            retryCount--;
            try {
                Thread.sleep(5000); // wait for 5 seconds before retrying
            } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        } else {
            logger.error("Error creating AttachmentContent for file " + filePath + ": " + String.join(", ", attachmentContentResponse.getErrors()));
            return null;
        }
    }
    
    logger.error("Failed to create AttachmentContent after retries.");
    throw new IOException("Failed to create AttachmentContent after 3 retries due to 502 Bad Gateway.");
}
```

### Explanation

- **Exception Throwing**: After three retries, the method throws an `IOException` if the attachment content could not be created due to repeated `502 Bad Gateway` errors.
- **Halting Execution**: If this exception is not caught elsewhere in your code, it will stop the execution of the program.

You can decide how to handle the exception based on your specific requirements. For example, you could catch it at a higher level in your code and log a final error message before stopping the entire process.
