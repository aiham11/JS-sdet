For your Goals & Objectives (G&O) related to continuing your learning in automation tools, you can set a clear and measurable goal. Here's a suggestion you can use and modify:

1. **Title**: Continue Learning Automation Tools
   - **Description**: Expand my expertise in automation tools, focusing on learning new frameworks and tools that can improve efficiency in test case management and migration processes, such as Selenium, Jenkins, or other CI/CD automation tools.
   - **Measurement Criteria**: Complete a course or certification in a new automation tool, apply the learned tool in at least one project by the end of the quarter, and demonstrate its effectiveness through improved process automation efficiency.

You can also break this down into smaller goals or focus on specific tools you're interested in learning.
