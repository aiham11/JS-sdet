To ensure that only files following the naming convention starting with `TS_` are migrated, you can modify the method to check the file name before attempting to attach it to the Rally test case.

Here’s the updated method:

### **Updated Method:**
```java
public void migrateFileAttachmentsFromTestStepsToTestCase(String rallyTestCaseOID, List<String> fileAttachmentPaths, RallyRestApi rallyApi) {
    if (rallyTestCaseOID == null || rallyTestCaseOID.isEmpty()) {
        logger.error("Rally TestCase ID is null or empty. Cannot migrate file attachments.");
        return;
    }

    for (String filePath : fileAttachmentPaths) {
        File file = new File(filePath);
        if (file.getName().startsWith("TS_")) {
            try {
                // Attach the file to the Rally test case
                String attachmentOID = attachFileToRallyTestCase(rallyApi, rallyTestCaseOID, filePath);
                if (attachmentOID != null) {
                    logger.info("Successfully migrated attachment to Test Case level for file: " + filePath);
                } else {
                    logger.error("Failed to migrate attachment for file: " + filePath);
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                logger.error("IO Exception occurred while migrating file attachment to Test Case level", e);
            }
        } else {
            logger.info("Skipped file " + filePath + " as it does not follow the naming convention.");
        }
    }
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **File Name Check:** The method checks if the file name starts with `TS_` before processing it.
- **Logging:** If a file doesn’t follow the naming convention, it logs that the file was skipped.
  
### **Usage in `RunnerClass`:**

```java
// After you have downloaded the file attachments locally:
List<String> fileAttachmentDownloadPathsTestStepLevel = jiraOperation.jiraAttachmentsDownload(jiraTestCase.getKey(), "teststep", "file");

// Now call the method to migrate only those files following the naming convention
rallyOperation.migrateFileAttachmentsFromTestStepsToTestCase(rallyTestcaseOID, fileAttachmentDownloadPathsTestStepLevel, rallyRestApi);
```

This ensures that only files with names starting with `TS_` are migrated from the test steps to the test case level in Rally.
