The `NullPointerException` you're encountering is because the `response` object in the `getJiraResponse` method is null, which means that the HTTP request didn't execute successfully, and as a result, the `response` is not set.

### Steps to Diagnose and Resolve:

1. **Check the `getJiraResponse` Method**:
   - Ensure that the `response` object is not null before trying to access its entity.
   - Add logging to capture the response status and any errors.

Here’s how you can modify the `getJiraResponse` method to handle this:

```java
public static HttpEntity getJiraResponse(String url, String apiKey) {
    CloseableHttpClient connection = HttpClients.createDefault();
    HttpGet request = new HttpGet(url);
    request.setHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + apiKey);
    CloseableHttpResponse response = null;
    try {
        response = connection.execute(request);
        int statusCode = response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode();
        if (statusCode >= 200 && statusCode < 300) {
            HttpEntity entity = response.getEntity();
            if (entity != null) {
                logger.info("Successfully returned HttpEntity response for the URL " + url);
                return entity;
            } else {
                logger.error("Received empty response entity for the URL: " + url);
            }
        } else {
            logger.error("Failed to fetch the response from the URL: " + url + ". HTTP Status Code: " + statusCode);
        }
    } catch (ClientProtocolException e) {
        logger.error("ClientProtocolException occurred in Jira connection while connecting to " + url, e);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        logger.error("IOException occurred in Jira connection while connecting to " + url, e);
    } finally {
        try {
            if (response != null) {
                response.close();
            }
            connection.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            logger.error("Error occurred while closing resources.", e);
        }
    }
    return null; // Return null if the response or entity was not obtained successfully
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Check HTTP Status Code**: The method now checks if the response status code is in the 200 range (successful response).
- **Log Errors**: Errors are logged if the response is not successful or if the entity is null.
- **Close Resources**: Resources are closed in the `finally` block to ensure no resource leaks.

2. **Handle the Null Case in `downloadTestStepEmbeddedAttachments`**:
   - Since the `getJiraResponse` method might return `null`, make sure to handle that case in the `downloadTestStepEmbeddedAttachments` method to avoid further `NullPointerException`s.

Here’s how you might adjust `downloadTestStepEmbeddedAttachments` to handle null entities:

```java
HttpEntity response = Utils.getJiraResponse(absoluteUrl, apiToken);
if (response != null) {
    try (InputStream in = response.getContent()) {
        Path filePath = Paths.get(testStepAttachmentLocationToBeSaved + "/" + stepNumber + "_" + imageCount + "_" + "_EmbeddedFile_" + columnName + ".png");
        Files.copy(in, filePath, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);  // Overwrite if file exists
        filePaths.add(filePath.toString());
        EntityUtils.consume(response);
        logger.info("File downloaded from Jira to testStepAttachmentLocation. File Name: " + stepNumber + "_" + imageCount + "_" + "_EmbeddedFile_" + columnName + ".png");
    } catch (IOException e) {
        logger.error("Failed to download the file attachment " + stepNumber + "_" + imageCount + "_" + "_EmbeddedFile_" + columnName + " from Jira for test step level", e);
    }
} else {
    logger.error("Failed to download the file attachment from Jira. No Entity response found for URL: " + absoluteUrl);
}
```

### Summary:
- The issue likely arises when the `getJiraResponse` method encounters an issue with the HTTP request and returns null, leading to a `NullPointerException` later when you try to access the `response` object.
- By checking for null and logging the issue, you can better understand what might be going wrong with the HTTP request and take corrective action.
