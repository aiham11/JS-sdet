Given that the same error persists, it appears that the issue is related to how the Rally API is processing the Base64-encoded content. Since all typical steps to ensure the proper encoding and format have been followed, it's possible that the issue lies in how the API is handling the request.

### Additional Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Try a Different Content Type**:
   - It's possible that the Rally API is not handling the `ContentType` as expected. Try using a different content type, such as `application/octet-stream`.

2. **Upload Without Base64 Encoding**:
   - Rally's API might not require the `Content` to be Base64-encoded. Try sending the raw bytes instead of encoding them.

### Example with Raw Content:

Let's try uploading the content without Base64 encoding:

```java
private static String uploadRawAttachmentToRally(RallyRestApi restApi, String testCaseRef) throws IOException {
    // Content as a raw string (without Base64 encoding)
    String testContent = "This is a test file for Rally attachment upload.";
    byte[] fileContent = testContent.getBytes(); // Get the file content as bytes

    JsonObject attachment = new JsonObject();
    attachment.addProperty("Artifact", testCaseRef);
    attachment.addProperty("Content", new String(fileContent));  // Use raw content instead of Base64
    attachment.addProperty("Name", "TestAttachment.txt");
    attachment.addProperty("ContentType", "text/plain");  // Try different content types if needed
    attachment.addProperty("Size", fileContent.length);  // Actual size in bytes of the file content

    // Debug: Print the attachment JSON object
    System.out.println("Attachment JSON: " + attachment.toString());

    CreateRequest attachmentRequest = new CreateRequest("Attachment", attachment);
    CreateResponse attachmentResponse = restApi.create(attachmentRequest);

    if (attachmentResponse.wasSuccessful()) {
        return attachmentResponse.getObject().get("_ref").getAsString();
    } else {
        // Debugging output
        System.out.println("Error occurred creating attachment:");
        System.out.println("Response Errors: " + Arrays.toString(attachmentResponse.getErrors()));
        System.out.println("Response Warnings: " + Arrays.toString(attachmentResponse.getWarnings()));
        return null;
    }
}
```

### How to Call This:

Replace your existing code with this example and test it in your `main` method:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    RallyRestApi restApi = new RallyRestApi(new URI("https://rally1.rallydev.com"), "_YourAPIKeyHere_");
    restApi.setApplicationName("AttachmentUploadTest");

    try {
        String testCaseRef = "https://rally1.rallydev.com/slm/webservice/v2.0/testcase/799083473551"; // Your test case reference

        // Call the raw content method
        String attachmentRef = uploadRawAttachmentToRally(restApi, testCaseRef);

        if (attachmentRef != null) {
            System.out.println("Successfully uploaded attachment: " + attachmentRef);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed to upload attachment.");
        }
    } finally {
        restApi.close();
    }
}
```

### Notes:
- **Raw Content**: If Rally's API does not expect Base64-encoded content, sending the raw bytes might resolve the issue.
- **Content-Type**: Consider testing different content types (e.g., `application/octet-stream`) if `text/plain` doesn't work.

### Last Resort:
- **Contact Rally Support**: If this still does not work, it's advisable to contact Rally's support. They may have specific requirements or known issues with attachment uploads that aren't immediately clear from the documentation.

This troubleshooting process should help determine if the problem is with how the API expects the content or if there's an underlying issue with Rally's API itself.
