Hi, my name is Peter Stabnick. I am the eFax system administrator for Optum. Today I will be discussing the value adds that have been added to accelerate the user account creation process. On average, 50 new account requests are received every 30 days.
Before creating a Microsoft Form, it would on average take three hours of effort or 11 days turnaround time to create a user account. Resulting from limited information acquired from the ServiceNow requests, the cause of the lengthy turnaround time was identified as a result of needing additional information, this necessitated having multiple interactions with the users. to improve this process, we created a Microsoft form which takes users approximately five minutes to complete. The use of a Microsoft Form enables the use of mandatory data fields and data validation. This implementation has resulted in a faster to market response and greater user satisfaction as it has streamlined the account creation process. The expected savings from this implementation are 1,750 hours of labor or $122k annually, an overall productivity improvement of 97% Thank you for your time!
