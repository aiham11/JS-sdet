Here is the full `JiraAttachment.java` class, which represents an attachment associated with a Jira test case or test step:

```java
package com.optum.coe.automation.rally;

public class JiraAttachment {
    
    private String id;
    private String filename;
    private String url;

    public JiraAttachment(String id, String filename, String url) {
        this.id = id;
        this.filename = filename;
        this.url = url;
    }

    // Getter and Setter for id
    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    // Getter and Setter for filename
    public String getFilename() {
        return filename;
    }

    public void setFilename(String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
    }

    // Getter and Setter for url
    public String getUrl() {
        return url;
    }

    public void setUrl(String url) {
        this.url = url;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "JiraAttachment [id=" + id + ", filename=" + filename + ", url=" + url + "]";
    }
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Fields:**
   - `id`: Represents the unique identifier of the attachment in Jira.
   - `filename`: The name of the file associated with the attachment.
   - `url`: The URL from which the attachment can be downloaded.

2. **Constructors:**
   - A constructor that takes `id`, `filename`, and `url` as parameters to create a new `JiraAttachment` object.

3. **Getters and Setters:**
   - Methods to retrieve and set the `id`, `filename`, and `url` fields.

4. **`toString` Method:**
   - Provides a string representation of the `JiraAttachment` object, which can be useful for logging or debugging.

### **Usage:**
- The `JiraAttachment` class is typically used within the `JiraOperation` class or related classes to handle and manage attachments associated with Jira test cases or test steps.

This class should be integrated into your existing codebase where attachments from Jira are being handled. If you have further customization or additional features in mind, feel free to ask!
