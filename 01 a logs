when i run this query 
https://jira.healthcareit.net/rest/atm/1.0/testcase/search?fields=key&maxResults=10&query=projectKey+%3D+RHPQA+AND+%22Migrate+Test+to+Rally%22+%3D+true  

i get this message

{"errorMessages":["The query statement is not valid: projectKey = RHPQA AND \"Migrate Test to Rally\" = true"]}
even tho i have checked Migrate Test to Rally in the jira test case 
To form the correct query, you need to replace the custom field name `"Migrate Test to Rally"` with its internal field ID, which usually follows the format `cf[XXXX]`. Unfortunately, I cannot retrieve the exact custom field ID for you, but I can guide you to find it.

Hereâ€™s how you can find the custom field ID and form the correct query:

### Steps to Find the Custom Field ID:
1. In Jira, go to **Settings** > **Issues** > **Custom Fields**.
2. Search for the custom field "Migrate Test to Rally."
3. Click **Edit** or **Configure** for that field, and look at the URL in your browser. You should see something like this:
   ```
   https://jira.healthcareit.net/secure/admin/EditCustomField!default.jspa?id=12345
   ```
   The number at the end (`12345`) is the custom field ID.

### Full Correct Query:
Once you have the custom field ID, replace `cf[12345]` in the query with the actual ID, as shown below:

```plaintext
https://jira.healthcareit.net/rest/atm/1.0/testcase/search?fields=key&maxResults=10&query=projectKey+%3D+RHPQA+AND+cf[12345]+%3D+true
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
- `projectKey = RHPQA`: Filters the issues by the project with the key `RHPQA`.
- `cf[12345] = true`: Searches for issues where the custom field "Migrate Test to Rally" is checked (true).

Make sure to replace `12345` with the actual custom field ID you retrieve from Jira. This should work properly once you have the correct custom field reference.
