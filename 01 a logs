when i run this query 
https://jira.healthcareit.net/rest/atm/1.0/testcase/search?fields=key&maxResults=10&query=projectKey+%3D+RHPQA+AND+%22Migrate+Test+to+Rally%22+%3D+true  

i get this message

{"errorMessages":["The query statement is not valid: projectKey = RHPQA AND \"Migrate Test to Rally\" = true"]}
even tho i have checked Migrate Test to Rally in the jira test case
