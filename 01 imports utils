The logs indicate that there are a few key issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Malformed URL for Embedded Images**:
   - The URLs for embedded images are being treated as relative paths, but the code attempts to use them as if they were complete URLs.
   - Example: `"no protocol: ../rest/tests/1.0/attachment/image/500125"` means that the code is trying to create a `URL` object with a relative path, which Java doesn't support directly.

2. **Errors in Uploading Attachments to Rally**:
   - There are errors like `Cannot parse object reference from "iVBO..."`. This suggests that there might be a problem in the way the attachments are being read or uploaded.

### Steps to Fix These Issues

1. **Correcting the URL for Embedded Images**:
   - You need to construct a full URL from the relative path provided by JIRA. This can be done by appending the relative path to the base JIRA URL.

2. **Handling the Uploading of Attachments**:
   - The issue with parsing object references seems to stem from incorrect handling of the attachment data. Ensure that the file data is being correctly read and uploaded.

### Updated Code Implementation

Hereâ€™s how you can update the relevant parts of your code:

#### 1. **Updating the Downloading of Embedded Images**:
In your `JiraOperation.java`, modify the method `downloadImage` to handle relative paths:

```java
// Method to download images (from relative URLs)
public String downloadImage(String baseUrl, String relativeUrl) {
    try {
        URL fullUrl = new URL(baseUrl + relativeUrl.replace("../", "/"));
        String downloadedFilePath = Utils.downloadFileFromURL(fullUrl, "downloaded_" + System.currentTimeMillis() + "_" + getFileNameFromUrl(relativeUrl));
        return downloadedFilePath;
    } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
        logger.error("Failed to download embedded image from URL: " + relativeUrl, e);
        return null;
    }
}
```

- **`baseUrl`**: This is the base URL for your JIRA instance (e.g., `https://jira.healthcareit.net`).
- **`relativeUrl`**: This is the relative path provided (e.g., `../rest/tests/1.0/attachment/image/500125`).
- **`replace("../", "/")`**: This ensures that the relative path is correctly appended to the base URL.

#### 2. **Fixing the Uploading of Attachments to Rally**:
In your `RallyOperation.java`, ensure that you are handling file reading and uploading correctly:

```java
// Modified attachFileToRallyTestCase method
public boolean attachFileToRallyTestCase(RallyRestApi rallyApi, String rallyTestCaseOID, String filePath) {
    try {
        File file = new File(filePath);
        if (!file.exists() || !file.isFile()) {
            logger.error("File does not exist or is not a file: " + filePath);
            return false;
        }
        
        // File to byte array
        byte[] fileBytes = Files.readAllBytes(file.toPath());
        String base64FileData = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(fileBytes);

        // Create the attachment
        JsonObject attachment = new JsonObject();
        attachment.addProperty("Artifact", rallyTestCaseOID);
        attachment.addProperty("Content", base64FileData);
        attachment.addProperty("ContentType", "image/png");  // or appropriate MIME type
        attachment.addProperty("Name", file.getName());
        attachment.addProperty("Description", "Attachment uploaded from JIRA");
        
        // Send request to Rally
        // Assume createAttachment is a method to send this to Rally
        JsonObject response = createAttachment(rallyApi, attachment);  // Create this method to handle the API call
        
        if (response == null || response.get("Errors").getAsJsonArray().size() > 0) {
            logger.error("Failed to upload attachment: " + filePath);
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        logger.error("Error reading or uploading file: " + filePath, e);
        return false;
    }
}
```

### How to Use the `downloadImage` Method

When downloading embedded images:

```java
for (JiraTestStep step : testSteps) {
    for (String embeddedImageUrl : step.getEmbeddedImageUrls()) {
        String downloadedImagePath = jiraOperation.downloadImage(ConfigLoader.getConfigValue("JIRA_BASE_URL"), embeddedImageUrl);
        if (downloadedImagePath != null) {
            stepAttachmentPaths.add(downloadedImagePath);
        }
    }
    // Attach files to Rally for this step
    rallyOperation.attachFilesToTestStep(rallyRestApi, rallyTestcaseOID, step.getIndex(), stepAttachmentPaths);
    Utils.deleteAttachmentFileFromLocal(stepAttachmentPaths);
}
```

This should address the issues you're seeing with malformed URLs and attachment upload failures.
