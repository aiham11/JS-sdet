Since using the custom field ID (`cf[9264]`) is not working, but the field is clearly present in the `RHPQA` project based on the API response, the issue likely lies in how Jira is interpreting the query or field configuration within the project. Let's focus on other potential ways to address this:

### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Verify Field Values via API**:
   Use the following query to list test cases with **custom field values**:
   
   ```plaintext
   https://jira.healthcareit.net/rest/atm/1.0/testcase/search?fields=key,customFieldValues&maxResults=10&query=projectKey+%3D+RHPQA
   ```
   
   This will return both the `key` and the `customFieldValues` for each test case. Check whether the "Migrate Test to Rally" field is present and what values are being returned. This will help confirm if there are indeed any test cases where this field is `true`.

2. **Try Using the Field Name Directly in the Query**:
   Since the ID isn't working, continue using the **field name** "Migrate Test to Rally" directly in your query. Jira may allow querying by field name if the field is correctly configured for the project:

   ```plaintext
   https://jira.healthcareit.net/rest/atm/1.0/testcase/search?fields=key&maxResults=10&query=projectKey+%3D+RHPQA+AND+"Migrate+Test+to+Rally"+%3D+true
   ```

   Make sure the field name matches exactly what is used in Jira (case sensitivity might play a role). Test both with and without quotes around the field name.

3. **Manual Check via Jira UI**:
   - Search for test cases in the `RHPQA` project that are supposed to have "Migrate Test to Rally" set to `true` in the Jira UI.
   - Manually verify that there are test cases where the field is set to `true`. This will ensure that the field is being used as expected in this project.

4. **Field Context Issue**:
   If querying by the field name or ID still doesn’t work, the issue might be related to the **field context** in `RHPQA`. Even though the field appears in the test cases, it might not be configured to be queried in JQL for this project. You’ll need a Jira admin to:
   - Verify that the field is properly configured for the `RHPQA` project.
   - Ensure that it is available for all issue types within the project.

5. **Try a Broader Query**:
   To troubleshoot further, try a query that doesn’t check for `true/false` values but instead just checks for the presence of the field:

   ```plaintext
   https://jira.healthcareit.net/rest/atm/1.0/testcase/search?fields=key&maxResults=10&query=projectKey+%3D+RHPQA+AND+"Migrate+Test+to+Rally"+IS+NOT+EMPTY
   ```

   This will return test cases where the "Migrate Test to Rally" field is present, regardless of whether it’s `true` or `false`. This can help you confirm if the field is accessible in the project for querying.

### Summary:
- **Verify custom field values** using the first query.
- **Use the field name directly** if querying by field ID fails.
- **Check the Jira UI** manually to confirm the field is set to `true` for some test cases.
- **Ensure correct field context** with the help of a Jira admin.
- **Test with IS NOT EMPTY** to check for the presence of the field in the test cases.
