The logs indicate that the `JIRA_API_ENDPOINT` is being retrieved as `null`. This issue likely originates from one of the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Key in Configuration File:** The key `JIRA_API_ENDPOINT` might be missing or incorrectly specified in your `rally_migration_config.properties` file.
   
2. **Incorrect Path or Access to Configuration File:** The configuration file might not be correctly loaded, or there could be an issue accessing it.

Here's how you can troubleshoot this:

### 1. Verify the Configuration File
Open the `rally_migration_config.properties` file and check if the `JIRA_API_ENDPOINT` key is present and correctly spelled. It should look something like this:

```properties
JIRA_API_ENDPOINT=https://your-jira-instance/api/endpoint
```

### 2. Check the Configuration Loading
Ensure that the `ConfigLoader.getConfigValue("JIRA_API_ENDPOINT")` method is correctly loading the value from the file. You can add additional logging in the `ConfigLoader` class to confirm that the file is being loaded properly.

### 3. Add Logging in ConfigLoader
Add logging in your `ConfigLoader` class to verify whether the properties file is being read correctly:

```java
public static String getConfigValue(String key) {
    String value = properties.getProperty(key);
    if (value == null) {
        logger.error("Config key " + key + " is missing or has a null value.");
    } else {
        logger.info("Config key " + key + " loaded with value: " + value);
    }
    return value;
}
```

### 4. Test with a Hardcoded Value (Optional)
To confirm that the issue is with loading the config file, you can temporarily hardcode the `JIRA_API_ENDPOINT` in your code:

```java
String jiraApiEndpoint = "https://your-jira-instance/api/endpoint";
logger.info("Hardcoded Jira API Endpoint: " + jiraApiEndpoint);
```

If the hardcoded value works, the issue is likely in how the configuration is being loaded.

### 5. Ensure Proper File Loading
Make sure the path to the `rally_migration_config.properties` file is correctly set, and that the file is accessible to your application at runtime.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify why the `JIRA_API_ENDPOINT` is being retrieved as `null` and correct the issue.
